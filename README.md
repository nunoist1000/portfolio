# My professional portfolio!
A chance to demonstrate my coding skills, while also having the opportunity to integrate a chatbot!

# Home Page
Here is the main point of entry for the portfolio. I have some lottie files integrated from (https://lottiefiles.com/)

I also set up a contact form (https://formsubmit.co/)

Utilized markdown and columns to set up my social links for asthetics, but you can choose to continue down Col1 if you like!

I left the original background color within the cofig.toml file (in case you prefer that one over mine).

To demonstrate some experience with CSS I chose to do the custom route within styles.css.

## Bio.txt
This document is what is going to "train" your chatbot. So whatever you want a recruiter to be able to ask about you, should go in here!

# Resume Page
I wanted to put it in markdown, as I felt it was a more user friendly approach to displaying a resume, but also wanted any recruiters the opportunity to download a copy of it. 

## resume.md
This is the markdown version of your resume, feel free to use any of the formatting option to spruce up your resume!

# Hobbies Page
It is more to a person than a resume, and it was my hope to highlight this. 

## Images folder
This is where you need to put any images (.jpg,.png) you want to use for your portfolio, but also...this is where I put in my resume in pdf format. 

Once you create your portfolio, add and tag me on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/qepting). I'd love to celebrate your accomplishments and get inspired by your work! 🎉💡
